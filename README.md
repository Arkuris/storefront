# Storefront

## What is Store Front?
- Store Front is a application that allows for stores to input an api and get items to display on a storepage with custom catagories. It allows users to add, remove, or delete items from a cart. Checkout functionality still needs to be implemented, but besides that it seems to work pretty good! :D

## Notes for Grader.
- Lab 38 is now done now. I got my api to load the catagories and items. I refactored my code since lab 37 a few times now, and it has the same functionality as lab 37, but using the API provided in class. I did lose the inventory count that was availible with my hard coded items and categories. I will look to add that back in the future, but it is now 5pm and time to pack up haha. c:
